To calculate the two's complement of a 24-bit signed value in JavaScript and store it in a 32-bit integer type, you need to reconstruct the signed integer from the three bytes and handle the sign bit appropriately. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
function getSignedValue(byte0, byte1, byte2) {
    // Combine the three bytes into a 24-bit unsigned integer
    let value24 = (byte0 << 16) | (byte1 << 8) | byte2;

    // Check if the sign bit (bit 23) is set
    if (value24 & 0x800000) {
        // If the sign bit is set, subtract 2^24 to get the negative value
        value24 -= 0x1000000;
    }

    // Now, value24 is the signed 32-bit integer representation of your 24-bit signed value
    return value24;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Combine the Bytes:**
   - We start by combining the three bytes into a single 24-bit unsigned integer. This is done by shifting the bytes to their correct positions and using the bitwise OR operator to merge them.
     ```javascript
     let value24 = (byte0 << 16) | (byte1 << 8) | byte2;
     ```

2. **Handle the Sign Bit:**
   - In a 24-bit signed integer using two's complement representation, the most significant bit (bit 23) is the sign bit. If this bit is set (i.e., it's `1`), the number is negative.
   - We check if the sign bit is set using a bitwise AND operation with `0x800000` (which is `1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` in binary).
     ```javascript
     if (value24 & 0x800000) {
         value24 -= 0x1000000; // Subtract 2^24 to get the negative value
     }
     ```
   - If the sign bit is set, we subtract `0x1000000` (which is `2^24` or `16,777,216` in decimal) from the value to get the correct negative integer.

3. **Return the Signed Integer:**
   - After handling the sign bit, `value24` now holds the correct signed 32-bit integer representation of your original 24-bit signed value. You can now use this value as needed in your program.
     ```javascript
     return value24;
     ```

**Example Usage:**

Let's say you have the following bytes:

```javascript
let byte0 = 0xFF; // 255
let byte1 = 0xFF; // 255
let byte2 = 0x80; // 128
```

Using the function:

```javascript
let signedValue = getSignedValue(byte0, byte1, byte2);
console.log(signedValue); // Output: -128
```

This correctly interprets the bytes as a negative number in two's complement format.

**Note:**

- This method works because JavaScript's bitwise operators handle numbers as 32-bit signed integers.
- By adjusting the 24-bit value based on the sign bit, we ensure that the sign is correctly extended to the 32-bit representation.
- The range of the resulting signed integer will be from `-8,388,608` to `8,388,607`, which safely fits within a 32-bit signed integer.

**Summary:**

To calculate the two's complement of a 24-bit signed value in JavaScript:

- Combine the three bytes into a 24-bit integer.
- Check if the sign bit (bit 23) is set.
- If it's set, subtract `0x1000000` (16,777,216) to get the signed value.
- The result is a 32-bit signed integer representing the original 24-bit signed value.

**Answer:**

Combine the three bytes into a 24-bit integer, then if the top bit is set, subtract 0x1000000 to get the signed value:

```javascript
// Combine bytes into a 24-bit integer
let value24 = (byte0 << 16) | (byte1 << 8) | byte2;

// If sign bit (bit 23) is set, subtract 0x1000000 to get two's complement
if (value24 & 0x800000) {
    value24 -= 0x1000000;
}

// value24 now holds the signed 32-bit integer
